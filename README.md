# About

The Comm2IP utility application is used to create an interface between a (normal or virtual) serial port and an IP endpoint.

# Information / Usage

## What is Comm2IP?

The Comm2IP interface is used to create an interface between a (normal or virtual) serial port and an IP endpoint. You can use it, for example, for mapping your COM1 serial port to 127.0.0.1:52000 IP endpoint. Once the link has been created, all traffic sent to the IP endpoint will be forwarded to the serial port and vice verca.

Comm2IP is written in C#/.NET Framework, with a tiny size and minimal dependencies, and targets Win32/64 environments. I've used .NET v4 to build it, however you can safely built it with .NET v2 as well (you may need to modify the ```log4net``` configuration or references for .NET v2).

It comes in two flavors:

 * The **Comm2IP** library, which you can reference and use in your applications.
 * The **Comm2IPService** standalone application, which can be used either from the command line or as a Windows Service.

## Comm2IP library

TODO

## Comm2IPService application

Use this to create a Serial-To-IP link without writing code. There are two modes of operation: command line and Windows Service. Run `Comm2IPService` from the command prompt for syntax help.

### Using Comm2IPService from the command prompt

Run:

```
C:>Comm2IPService -a 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -c com1 -b 19200
```

to create a link between COM1 (baud rate @19200) and localhost, port 12000

### Using Comm2IPService as a Windows service

The Windows service supports up to 5 links (code configurable).

To alter the links, edit `Comm2IPService.exe.config` and check the **Bindings** sections. Each **Binding** accepts the same syntax that you use for the command line invocation.

Use:

```
C:>Comm2IPService --install
```

to install `Comm2IPService` as a Windows service.

Use:

```
C:>Comm2IPService --uninstall
```

to uninstall `Comm2IPService` Windows service.
